# JavaScript

JS (JavaScript) is a loose, dynamically typed and interpreted  scripting language. It began life as LiveScript (1995); when it was a project at Netscape Communications. At some point in time, it was renamed JavaScript (roughly around the time when plugin support for the Java language was added to Netscape Navigator).

Java and JavaScript are not related to each other, not even remotely, they simply share a commonality in their names.

JavaScript's popularity maybe attributed to it's ubiquity amongst web pages (client side JavaScript), but it is actually being used in lots of places other than web pages. JS can be ran on the server (Node.JS), it can be used to do MVC type development of web apps (Backbone.JS) and it can also be used to stitch together a bunch of Java apps together (Rhino); these are just some of the other uses of JavaScript. 

\marginpar{ECMAScript 262 Specification}JavaScript as we know it today, is the scripting language consistent with ECMAScript. ECMAScript is a standardized scripting language according to ECMA specification 262 and ISO/IEC 16262. ECMAScript exist in the form of JavaScript, ActionScript and JScript. If you are looking for language specification of JavaScript, you can look at the ECMAScript 262 specification

## Code Structure

1. **Variable** - a temporary storage for something. It can hold any type of data 
2. **Literals** - e.g. 10 is Number literal, "Hello" is a string literal
3. **Expression** - involves operand(s) and operators. e.g. *a + b or 1 + a or 15 % 12*
4. **Statement** - similar to expressions. They are (optionally) terminated by semicolon. They can be written either inside a function or outside a function
5. **Function (method)** - a programming block that (usually) have a name. A programming block is a bunch of statements grouped together and enclosed inside a pair of curly braces
6. **Source file** - contains JS functions and statements. Usually has a *.js* extension


## Data Types and Variable Declaration

You need to know what kinds of stuff you can create, define and manipulate in JS. 

1. Number
2. Boolean
3. String
4. Array
5. Object
6. Function
7. undefined
8. null
9. Object

The first three are simple data types in JS, the rest are not so simple (don't worry, we will try to define the *not so simple* types a bit down the road)

**Number** - 10, 2, 100 (integers), 2.3, 1.2 (floats) are numbers. JS does not discriminate whether it is of integral or float type. There's more; 0xFF, 0xCAFEBABE (hex or octal) are also considered numbers, and so are base 8 numbers (i.e. 0377)

When you try to store a value that is more than what a Number can hold, it can result to either *Infinity* or *-Infinity*. You can also get some weird results is *NaN* (not a number). The NaN can result if you try to do some illegal operations, i.e. divide something by zero. 

**Boolean** - either *true* or *false* 

**String** - A sequence of UNICODE characters, although, there is no concept of character arrays in JS. You can define Strings using either the single quote or double quote technique. i.e. "Hello World" is as good as 'Hello World'. You may insert escape characters in Strings like \verb|"Hello\n World".|

We will deal with the other data types a little bit later, these three are actually enough to keep us busy for now. 

You will usually bother with data types when you are either declaring variables or returning something from functions. If you need to see for your eyes how the JS runtime really treats this variable, this small code snippet should help

## Functions

A JS function is named code-block. A code block is a group of statements tucked inside a pair of opening and ending curly brace. 

~~~

/*
File name: hello.js
The hello world program in JavaScript
*/

foo();

function foo() {
	var s = "Hello World\n";
	console.log(s);
}

~~~

If you installed node.js (and I hope you did) you can run try this out on the command line using **$ node hello.js** 

The hello.js program is actually more verbose than it has to be,  it could have been written as

~~~
console.log("Hello World");
~~~

I wrote it that way to demonstrate a few more JS characteristics. /*    */ are comments. Comments are non-executable codes, the interpreter will ignore them, but they are useful in putting reminders or markers in your code. It can help others read your code as well. 

Functions are defined in JavaScript by using the word **function** then give it a name (hopefully a descriptive one), put open and close parentheses immediately after the function name, then put the pair of curly braces. 

The *console.log()* command is the STDIO library of Node.JS (although some browsers include this as part of their JavaScript runtime). This command routes the output to stderr and stdout (the command line screen) 

~~~

CANONICAL FORM OF THE FUNCTION

function <name> (<parameters) {
	// statements
[return <value>]
}

~~~

Functions can contain a *return* statement, take note of the following though;

1. Calling a function without a return statement - returns undefined
2. Calling a function with return statement, but does actually return anything - returns undefined
3. Calling a function with a return statement and a proper return value - returns the value

<span class="stress">CAUTION:</span> careful how you write your curly braces, JavaScript's defaults might produce unexpected results, see the following code

~~~

function goo() 
{

	return
	{									// this line is unreachable
		objprop: "Some obj property";
	}

}

~~~	

The statement will be unreachable because JavaScript would have inserted a semi-colon right after the **return** statement. The object literal is unreachable as a return value.


Functions are different from JS statements. Statements are executed at once as soon as it is encountered by interpreter. Functions on the other hand are *compiled* first, they are not executed when first encountered, intead, it will be parsed and stored for later use. 

Theres a lot more to JavaScript functions but we will stop here for now. The other characteristics of functions are better explained when we are the context of Object Oriented JavaScript and some more advanced concepts.

## Keywords

When you create identifiers, e.g. variable names, function names and class names, you need to stay away from certain words--the JavaScript reserved words. Here they are;


- break case catch continue debugger default
- delete do else finally for function if in
- instanceof new return switch this throw try
- typeof var void while with implements
- interface let package private protected
- public static yield class enum export 
- extends import super


Read the ECMA specification for keywords, I just listed them here for convenience. 

## Arithmetic Operators

These operators behave exactly as they behave in your calculator. + for adding, - subtracting, * multiplying and / for performing division. The only other operator in the arithmetic arsenal is the modulo (%) operator. It also performs divsion, but instead of giving you the quotient, it gives you the remainder. e.g. *156 % 12* gives you 3

## Boolean operators 

These operators allows you to compare things logically and do some equivalence tests. Boolean expresssions yields either true or false. 

The *&&* (logical AND), *||* (logical OR) and the *unary NOT !* operator allows you to perform logical comparissons. 


The **&&** operator yields true only if both operands are result to true. If you are coming from another language where this symbol has a short-circuit behavior, be careful. This operator evaluates both operands before yielding the truth value.

~~~


/*
	Simple test for && operator
*/


console.log(a() && b());

function a() {
	console.log("inside a");
	return true;
}

function b() {
	console.log("inside b");
	return false;
}

RESULT:

inside a
inside b
false

~~~

the **||** operator on the other hand requires that only one of the operands is true for the expression to return true. 

~~~


/*
	Simple test for || operator
*/


console.log(a() || b());

function a() {
	console.log("inside a");
	return true;
}

function b() {
	console.log("inside b");
	return false;
}

RESULT:

inside a
true

~~~

The || operator did not even evaluate function b() before returning the truth value. 


The other boolean operators **== != > < <= >=** and **!** are straight forward, you can read them in the ECMAScript specification if you prefer. 


## Control of program flow

You will need to know how to direct program flow. There are 3 ways; execute statements one after another (sequencing), execute some statements when some condition is true (branching) and performing some statements repeatedly while some conditions are true (looping or iteration). 


### if-else statement 

**if-else** is way to branch or reroute program control. When the expression inside the **if()** construct yields true, the statement inside the if block is executed. 

~~~

var i = 10;

if (i == 20) {
	console.log("true");
}
else {
	console.log("nah!");
} 

RETURNS nah!

~~~

Be careful when writing your comparisson operator. Here's a slightly modified version of the code above

~~~


var i = 10;

if (i = 20) {
	console.log("true");
}
else {
	console.log("nah!");
} 

RETURNS true

~~~

Can you spot the difference? The expression inside the if() construct is improperly written as an assignment rather than a test for equality--but JavaScript went to evaluate it anyway. Be careful with this one because this mistake is so easy to make. The reason this returned **true** is because an arithmetic assignment operation returns the zero value, and if you use a number where a boolean expression is expected, the number is convered to the *true* value. 

### Switch Statement

**Switch statement** is another way of branching. It is a bit more concise than the if-else statement, it allows for a different kind of construction. 


~~~

var s = "hello";
var ret;

switch (s) {

	case "he":
		ret = "he";
		break;
	case 1:
		ret = 1;
		break;
	case true:
		ret = "true";
		break;
	case "Hello".toLowerCase():
		ret = "Hello";
		break;
	default:
		ret = "nothing";
}

console.log(ret);

/*

RETURNS "Hello"

*/
~~~

The values listed in *case* statements can be Strings, booleans or numbers (a bit of a relief if you are coming the Java language where the case is restricted to integer values). Always add the *break* keyword inside the case statement lest you will have unintended consequences--without the break keyword, the program will overflow to the remaining statements of the *switch construct* even if a match has already been found. 

### While Statement

**While statement** is a looping mechanism. It requires a boolean value (or an expression that yields a boolean value) inside the **while()** construct. The statements inside the while block will be executed repeatedly as long as the expression inside while() is true. When the expression is no longer true, the loop terminates. 

~~~


var timetoexit = false;
var counter = 0;

while (!timetoexit) {
	console.log("counter = " + counter);
	if (counter++ == 10) timetoexit = true;
}

~~~

You can use the **break** keyword to break out of loops, like this

~~~

var timetoexit = false;
var counter = 0;

while (!timetoexit) {
	console.log("counter = " + counter);
	if (counter++ == 10) break;
}

~~~

The break keyword causes the program flow to ignore all the statements (if there are any) immediately following the *break* keyword and fall right outside the end of the while block where the program flow will resume.  

Another keyword related to loop structures is the **continue** keyword. It causes program flow to jump also

~~~


var timetoexit = false;
var counter = 0;

while (!timetoexit) {

	console.log("counter = " + counter);
	if (++counter == 10) {
		timetoexit = true;
		continue;	
	}
	console.log("*");
}

~~~

Unlike *break* though, **continue** causes program flow to ignore all the remaining statements until the end of the while block and jump right away to the beginning of the while loop---forcing the condition to get re-evaluated; this is the reason why our last asterisk never got printed. 

### For Statement

**For statement** is another looping mechanism. The for loop like the while loop allows you to iterate and perform a group of statements over and over again. 


~~~

CANONICAL FORM

for ([where to begin] ; [where to stop] ; [step]) {

}


~~~


A key concept in using the for loop is the counter (the step). Loop will perform all the statements inside the block for a finite and determined number of times. Each time that the whole block is evaluated, the step value is incremented. The incremented step value is then compared to the ending value, and when the ending value is reached, the for loop will then terminate. The program control will fall over to first statement immediately after the for loop block.

~~~

for (i = 1 ; i < 10 ; i++) {

	console.log(i);

}

~~~

The code sample above defines the starting point at 1 (i = 1), it will stop the loop execution when *i < 10*.  Each time the *for* loop is evaluated, the i variable will be incremented by 1 (i++).

Here is a another sample of the for loop.

~~~


var util = require('util')

var i = 1;
var j = 1;

for (i = 1 ; i < 10; i++) {

    for (j =1 ; j < 10; j++) {

        util.print(i * j + "\t");

    }

    util.print("\n");
}


/*

RESULT

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   
2   4   6   8   10  12  14  16  18  
3   6   9   12  15  18  21  24  27  
4   8   12  16  20  24  28  32  36  
5   10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  
6   12  18  24  30  36  42  48  54  
7   14  21  28  35  42  49  56  63  
8   16  24  32  40  48  56  64  72  
9   18  27  36  45  54  63  72  81

*/

~~~


This code requires the node.js library *util*. We can't use the STDIO (console.log) here because it automatically adds a CRLF (carriage return-line feed) while *util.print()* library does not. Node.JS has many libraries for convenient use, you just need to do the *require(libname)* statement if you want to use it. 

## Complex data types 

JS has some containers (stuff that can contain other stuff, that can contain other stuff … ). We will take a look at two of them right now---Arrays and Objects. These are not simple types like Numbers or Strings or Boolean. Instead of representing single values, Objects and Arrays can represent a collection of values. 


### Object

Lots of things are considered objects in JavaScript, even arrays and functions are objects, but let's not get distracted by that right now. Think of an object like a dictionary or the telephone yellow pages. It is just a collection of stuff. This stuff though has a format, it comes in pairs. The first part of the pair is a key, the other part of the pair is a value. Using the yellow pages analogy, the key is probably a person's name or name of a business. The value is the address or the phone number. The key has to be unique, you cannot have more than one key with exactly the same name. 

The value part of each pair could be anything. It could be simple data (Numbers, Booleans, Strings) or it could be complex data (Arrays, Objects or functions).

There are a couple of ways to create objects in JS.

1. Using object literals
2. Using the new keyword against the Object type
3. Constructor functions

Try your best to ignore number 3 above (at least for now) -- we will circle around that later when we get to JavaScript OOP.

### Using Object literals

~~~

var obj = {} // this one constructs an empty object
var pt 	= {x:0, y:0} // an object with simple data types as members
var person = {

	name: "John Doe",
	email: "johndoe@somewhere.com",

} // an object that has two members, both of which are Strings

~~~

When you use object literals to initialize objects, don't forget to separate the pairs using comma. You can add properties (the key-value pair) to objects by simply declaring the member--using the dot notation--and assigning them values

~~~

person.date_hired = "some date value";
person.address = "some address";

~~~

Similarly, you can access values of the object properties using the dot notation as well, although this is not the only way.

~~~

console.log(person.name);
console.log(person.address);

~~~

JavaScript's use of dot notation to access object properties and method will feel very familiar with devs because a lot of programming languages utilizes this notation too. What might not feel familiar will be the fact that JS can also access object properties using square brackets. Like this


~~~

person["name"];
person["address"];

~~~

JS objects are actually associative arrays---I need to clarify one point, when I write **Array** (capitalized) I am referring to the JavaScript complex type. When I write **array** (lowercase) I am referring to the array data structure in general, what I mean by this is a collection of rows (and sometimes columns). An object looks like an array because it a collection of **named** values, this is the reason you can use the square braces approach to reference a member of a specific object. 


### Arrays

An Array is also a collection of values. Unlike an object, an Array is a collection of *ordered values*, not *named values*. Each member of an Array is called an element. Each element is denoted by a numeric position in the array--the position is called an index. Like objects, Arrays can be created using a variety of ways;

~~~

var a = []; //an empty array
var b = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]; //an array with 7 elements
var c = ["Hello", "World", 1, 2.0, 0xFF]; //an array with members of diff types
var d = [[1,1], [2,2],[3,3]]; // an array with members, which are also arrays. 

~~~

The other way to create an Array is to use the **Array()** constructor

~~~

var a = new Array(); //equivalent to var a = []
var b = new Array(1,2,3,4,5,6,7);
var c = new Array("Hello", "World", 1, 2.0, 0xFF);
var d = new Array(new Array(1,1), new Array(2,2), new Array(3,3));

var e = new Array(5); //with 5 new elements

~~~

If you call the Array constructor with a single integer as parameter, it means you are specifying the length of the Array--you are not declaring an array with a single element, and the number you passed is the value of the first element.

Array members can be retrieved by accessing the individual elements. Arrays are zero-based, hence the first element is index 0.

~~~

b[0] =  8; //assigns the value 8 to the first element of the Array
console.log(b[2]); //prints the value of the third element (remember, zero based)

~~~

The characteristic of arrays having index positions makes them ideal for iterating using a for-loop. You cannot access members of an array using the dot notation--like you did when you accessed members of an object.


## Anonymous Functions

We have already taken a look at functions earlier. At first glance, functions in Javascript does not seem too special. Like in any other language, we used it to contain a bunch of statements and gave it a name. This name, when we call them at a later time, will execute the set of commands inside its block. We use the function simply as an encapsulation unit for a sequence of statements.

Functions in JavaScript has some twists that may seem weird at first (depending on where you are coming from). The dynamic characteristic of the language presents a lot of possibilites--and some suprises too. Take a look at the following code


~~~


function foo() {
	return 10;
}

console.log(foo()); 	//nothing surprising here, 
						//it will return 10

foo = "Hello World"; 	//This is allowed in JS, 
						//because it is not strongly typed
console.log(foo); 		//This will now output "Hello World". 
						//It has already forgotten that 
						//it was a function
						//before
console.log(foo());		//this one will throw an error, 
						//because foo is no longer a function

~~~	

JavaScript function names are not that different from ordinary variables. You can assign them values, just like how you would an ordinary variable. Similarly, you can assign functions to variables; like this

~~~

var foo = function() {
	return 10;
}

console.log(foo()); //returns 10

~~~

This is another way to create a function. Notice that the function on the right hand side of the equal sign does not have a name. Notice also that we can assign it to a regular variable named "foo" then invoked **foo()**. What we have just done was create an anonymous function and assigned it to variable *foo*. It is called an anonymous function, for obvious reasons, it does not have a name. There are other ways to create functions in JS, but we will stop here because we don't have any further use for another way to create a function, what we have is quite enough for now.

## Objects, again


A few things we need to remember (or know for the first time) about objects. 


\marginpar{Objects in JavaScript are reference types}Object in JavaScript are not value types, you can declare as many reference variables pointing to the exact same object

~~~

//filename: multiref.js

var obj1 = {
	name: "firstobject"
}

var obj2 = obj1; // both obj1 and obj2 
					//reference var is pointing to the same object

console.log(obj2.name); //exact same property as obj1

obj2.anothername = "still first object";
console.log(obj1.anothername); //obj1 should have "anothername" as well, 
					//because object 2 is pointing to the same object 
					//being referenced by obj1

~~~


\marginpar{Mutable types}**Some object's structure can be modified (mutable)**. An array is actually an object, it is a good example of an object that is mutable. Mutability means that as you modify the content or structure of the object, it does not spawn or create newer objects. It modifies the original object that was created. 

\marginpar{immutable types}And then, some objects cannot be modified (immutable). The String objects that you create are such examples of immutable objects in JS. To add this list, Numbers and Booleans (when wrapped) are also immutable. What this means is that if you apply transformations to immutable objects, they will not modify the original object that was created. The transformation will cause the object to create a new object. 

~~~


var assert = require('assert');

var s = "A String";
var stemp = s;	//s and stemp points to "A String"

assert(stemp == s, "checking is s is equal to stemp"); // result is ok

s = s + "Hello World";

assert(stemp == s, "checking is s is equal to stemp"); // result not ok

~~~
	
If Strings are mutable, then the second assert would not have failed. The references "s" and "stemp" are simply no longer pointing to the same object. Any transformation that you apply on an immutable object will cause the creation of a new object, the original content plus any transformation you applied will now be contained inside the new object. By the way, **assert** works pretty much like a test for truth or falsity, but it behaves violently. When the expression inside the assert (the asserted value) does not evaluate to true, your code will fail with a pretty ugly run-time error. Defensive programmers use this to test their codes mercilessly, better that the code fails during development time, rather than the code failing in front of hte users. 

###Pass by Reference

~~~
function Base() {

	this.prop1 = "Property 1"

}

var a = new Base();		// Property 1
console.log(a.prop1);

paramPass(a);
console.log(a.prop1);	// Altered prop1


function paramPass(arg) {
	arg.prop1 = "Altered prop1";
	console.log("While inside ParamPass : Base.prop1 = " + arg.prop1 );
	// this outputs Altered prop1
	return 0;
}

~~~

When you pass object references to functions as parameters, whatever changes you make to the object (that was passed) will endure even after the function goes out of execution scope.


## Objects with Functions


Objects are easy to create, construct and modify in JS. Adding a property to an object takes nothing more than declarating the name of the property (attached to the object using the dot notation), then simply assigning a value to to it. Just don't forget that objects in JS are like hash tables, each member of the object is a pair of data, the first one is the key and the second one is the value. 

You can put any type of member inside an object. A member could be any data type in JS, simple data or complex data---which means you can put another object inside another object. This is the part we need to make a leap on our JS knowledge. **Functions** in JS are objects as well, that's right. Which means, we can put functions inside objects, and when functions are inside objects, they become methods of the objects. 

~~~
// file: obj3.js

var employee =  {
	
	name: "Ted", 
	work: function() {
		console.log(this.name + " is working")
	}
}

employee.work();
~~~

The preceding code sample is straightforward, it is a simple creation of an object using object literals. The second property though, used an anonymous function which was assigned to the property named "work". When we invoked the *work()* property as function---as we should, because it is a function, it then executed whatever was defined inside the function block.  

If we need another object, we need to repeat whatever we did on the first employee object, like so;


~~~

var employee =  {
	
	name: "Ted", 
	work: function() {
		console.log(this.name + " is working")
	}
}

employee.work();

var rommel = {};
rommel.name = "Rommel";
rommel.work = function() {
	console.log(this.name + " is working");
}

rommel.work();
~~~

While this is perfectly legal to do, the idiom used in creating the *rommel* object is bit bitter to the taste, surely, there has to be a way to achieve some sort *Object factory* idiom in JS. The code is too malleable (it could be a good thing though). It seems that following this idiom, one can pretty much add properties as you go along. I am sure there is a class of problems where this kind of flexibility and malleability is desired, probably necessary even. Coming from a language that supported classical OOP (like Java), it can send some chill on the spine knowing that I could easily change properties of my object anywhere in the code. Fortunately, JS is very orthogonal language---there are lots of ways of achieving same results, so let's look for something more palatable for classical OO programmers.

~~~
// Employee object: Template

function Employee(name,id, dept) {
	this.name = name;
	this.id = id;
	this.dept = dept;	

	this.work = function () {
		console.log(this.name + " is working")
	}

}

// Company object: Template

function Company() {
	this.employees = [];
	
	this.recruit = function(employee) {
		this.employees.push(employee);
	}
	
	this.listEmployees = function() {
		arrlength = this.employees.length;
		for (i = 0; i < arrlength; i++) {
			console.log(this.employees[i]);
		}
	}	
}


var ted = new Employee("Ted H", 39, "swd" );
var kit = new Employee("Kit A", 31, "swd");
var pepper = new Employee("Pepper F", 2, "admin");

var rd = new Company();


rd.recruit(ted);
rd.recruit(kit);
rd.recruit(pepper);

rd.listEmployees();

~~~

The preceding code feels a bit firmer than the one before it. This code used the function as some sort of constructor (actually, it is called exactly that, a function constructor). JavaScript does not have class mechanisms like Java or C++. Code reuse is not achieved by class extensions, but rather by Object extensions. By the way, this last code we just did sure looks a lot like the class mechanism, if you could just get over the fact that it said **function** rather than *class*. 

There a couple of things we need to talk about in this code, specifically they keyword **this**, but before we go there, let's look at another code, it is exactly the *Employee* and *Company* constructor code also, but with a bit of modification. 


~~~
// Company.js

// Employee object: Template

function Employee(name,id, dept) {
	this.name = name;
	this.id = id;
	this.dept = dept;	
}

Employee.prototype.work = function () {
	console.log(this.name + " is working")
}


// Company object: Template

function Company() {
	this.employees = [];
}

Company.prototype.recruit = function(employee) {
	this.employees.push(employee);
}

Company.prototype.listEmployees = function() {
	arrlength = this.employees.length;
	for (i = 0; i < arrlength; i++) {
		console.log(this.employees[i]);
	}
}

var ted = new Employee("Ted H", 39, "swd" );
var kit = new Employee("Kit A", 31, "swd");
var pepper = new Employee("Pepper F", 2, "admin");

var rd = new Company();


rd.recruit(ted);
rd.recruit(kit);
rd.recruit(pepper);

rd.listEmployees();

## Inheritance 

You can use JavaScript pretty much in a procedural way--what I mean by that is, without using coarse grained abstractions for interesting objects of your problem domain--but as soon as you find yourself coding way past 300 lines of code (give or take a 100 lines), you might find yourself in a (pretty) mess. The code becomes incresingly complex and increasingly difficult to change or introduce new features. Soon you need to find a way to compartmentalize the mess, you will still deal with the mess, but with OO abstractions, the messes are in bigger boxes. Inheritance is one of the bigger concepts in OO programming, here's one way to do them in JS.

~~~
var Person = function() {
	this.work = function() {
		console.log("Person working");
	}
	this.managing = function() {
		console.log("should not be implemented here");
	}
}

var Manager = function() {
	this.managing = function() {
		console.log("am managing");
	}
}

Manager.prototype = new Person;

var m = new Manager();
m.work();		// Person working
m.managing(); 	// am managing

console.log("Keys : " + Object.keys(m));
console.log("isPrototypeOf manager : " + Person.prototype.isPrototypeOf(m)); 
console.log("getPrototypeOf m : " + Object.getPrototypeOf(m));


console.log("m instanceof Manager  :" + (m instanceof Manager)); //true
console.log("m instanceof Person   :" + (m instanceof Person)); //true
console.log("m instance of Object  :" + (m instanceof Object)); //true
console.log("m instanceof Function :" + (m instanceof Function)); //false

JavaScript is an OO language but it is not class-based. There are no templates (classes) you can use to create objects. Objects, in JavaScript are created using other objects; more specifically, they are created using the function object. There is a way to create an object in JS using a literal, but we are not interested in those, we are interested in objects created using constructor functions. 

When you create a constructor function (like Manager and Person, in the examples above), they will have a property called *prototype*. A prototype is an object whose properties are shared by all the objects that have that prototype . In the example above, Manager inherits from Person via the code **Manager.prototype = new Person**. Whatever Person have, Manager will also have.  

To override an inherited method, simply redefine (reimplement) the method in inheriting class (the child class), that makes the method polymorphic. When you invoke a method against an object, the method will be searched (first) on the child class, if the method is not found, the search will go up the prototype chain until the method definition is found.
